# code-quiz
This project was designed as a homework assignment for UofT's coding bootcamp.

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application demonstrates the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers are correct. It then generates a score and a final page of results.
